# Xbox-Kodi-19.3-WORKAROUND
EDIT: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. This will be have to be deleted AFTER kodi gets updated again so it can use the official version. There's instructions on how to delete it but I can't figure it out. You may have to uninstall and reinstall kodi.  EDIT 2: They said having the workaround when the new update comes out won't break anything so if you absolutely can't wait for the update then try this  Found this on the kodi website and have tried it myself. Currently watching something on Seren
TEMPORARY WORKAROUND

tutorial
Go to Kodi settings > file manager > add source

Click <none> and type in https://f.mjh.nz/

Move down and then name it MJH

Go to Kodi settings > System > Add-ons > Enable Unknown Sources

Go to Kodi settings > Addons > Install from zip file (select Yes to first dialog)

Navigate to MJH > xbox

Select xbmc.python.zip to install it

Addons should now work again

.

EDIT 3:

Once Kodi 19.4 with a fix is released, it's best to revert what was done above so Kodi goes back to automatically updating those add-ons.

THIS STEP IS FOR WHEN THE NEXT KODI UPDATE IS AVAILABLE if you do this workaround.
It is RECOMMENDED to delete the xbmc.python folder ONCE THE NEXT KODI UPDATE IS OUT. TO DO THIS:

Go to kodi settings > file manager > add source

Click browse > home folder > addons > ok

In file manager click the addons folder you just added. At the bottom will be the xbmc.python folder. Bring up the context menu (X button) and hit delete.

Restart Kodi
